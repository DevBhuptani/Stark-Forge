### Stark-Forge: NFT Minting DApp

**Project Description:**

This is a decentralized application (DApp) built with Next.js and React that allows users to generate and mint their own NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). The app uses AI to generate unique images based on user prompts, uploads them to IPFS, and mints them on the blockchain.

## Features

1. **AI-based Image Generation**
   - Users can input a prompt, and the app generates an image using AI.
2. **Connect Wallet**
   - Users can connect their StarkNet wallet to interact with the blockchain.
3. **Mint NFTs**
    - Users can mint their generated image as an NFT on the blockchain after uploading the image to IPFS.

4. **IPFS Integration**
    - Generated images are uploaded to IPFS using Pinata for decentralized storage.
5. **Blockchain Interaction** 
    - The app interacts with a StarkNet smart contract to mint NFTs.

**Vision:**

The **Stark-Forge** project aims to empower creators and artists by providing an accessible platform for generating and minting unique NFTs using advanced AI technology. Our vision is to democratize the NFT space, making it easier for anyone—regardless of technical expertise—to bring their creative ideas to life and share them with the world.
